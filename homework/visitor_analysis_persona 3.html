				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>YouTube reaches a diverse audience. I wouldn’t say YouTube targets a specific audience, as it is mainly user-uploaded content that could interest many ages. These people live somewhere where they can have access to computers and the Internet. I would say the average everyday person uses YouTube, regardless of income and education level.  YouTube provides hosting for videos on countless topics. Videos are found by user the search bar. This allows users to find videos based off title or owner. The search engine has more popular videos up top, and obscure videos on later pages. The site made this experience enjoyable by clearly distinguishing between each video and there isn’t unnecessary information. The search bar suggests videos and it’s easy to find something even if you don’t have much information. Yes, I think that it facilitated for people in a mobile environment. It was fitted for the screen and was easy to navigate using the search bar, scrolling, and the logo brings the user back to the homepage.</p>

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
				<p>Jane Doe is a Freshman at Brigham Young University-Idaho, who is currently just taking her foundations courses. She is 19 years old and is living at Centre Square with her best friend from High School. She has high standards for herself when it comes to grades and her social life. She would like to get A’s in all her classes and is willing to get help from outside resources. She goes to classes and then does homework until it is finished. If she has extra time she likes to work out and spend times with friends. She is active in Church and would one day like to marry in the LDS Temple. She is very proficient when navigating the web and often searches Google and YouTube for homework help. She also uses YouTube to listen to music while studying and performing other daily tasks such as cleaning and getting ready.

				<h2>Site Contrast</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>The bad website that I found that provided contrast to the usability of YouTube is the Facebook website. Both websites are filled with user-uploaded content. But I feel like YouTube does a better job of organizing it in a user friendly way.  Both websites don’t have a specific age group they specifically try to target. Each met the needs, but YouTube is easier to navigate and is simpler. The content on Facebook has unneeded information that makes the main points blend in. When you click on something it’s hard to leave and you lose your place in the newsfeeds. YouTube follows the idea of Less is More, which I liked!</p>
