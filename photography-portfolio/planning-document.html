        <h1>Planning Document</h1>
        <p>For my project I will be creating a web portfolio for my photography.</p>
        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of my project will be to showcase the skills I have learned in my photography class this semester. I do this in hope of being able to use my portfolio as a tool to help me get a job as both a photographer and web designer/developer. Each photo I use I will also add a description of the process I used to take the photo, which would include my shutter speed, aperture, focal length, if I used a tripod, and any form of auxiliary lighting I used. Each description will also add any form of edits I used. I will include several categories of photos to show my skills in diverse settings.
            <br>
            <strong>Purpose Statement:</strong> To create a photography portfolio to showcase my skills to a job market.
        </p>
        <h2>The Audience</h2>
        <p>My audience is those who I want to one-day work for. I specifically have The Disney Company in mind. I would like to one day participate in their Disney College Program as a Photo Pass Photographer. I will design my pages around what they would be looking for, such as groups and events. The Disney Company needs a photographer who can take pictures with guests and also of the attractions in the parks. When recruiters are looking at my web site they are looking for skills of an experienced photography. However, the recruiter probably does not have personal experience with taking photos, so I will need lots of examples and explanations of my processes. They will look at my web site using a desktop, as they will most likely be looking at it during the workday. My website needs to be straightforward and easy to navigate as they have many different applications to look at.</p>
        <h2>Web Pages</h2>
        <p>I plan on having the following pages on my website:
            <br><strong>Home- </strong>This will be the page that my users will see when they first come to my website. It will tell a little about my experience with photography, as well as a portrait of myself.
            <br><strong>Portraits-</strong> These photos will be of people.
            <br><strong>Fine Art-</strong> These images will be some more professional ones that could be printed off and framed in houses.
            <br><strong>Landscape-</strong>This page will showcase photos of landscapes and buildings.
            <br><strong>Portrait-</strong>This page will showcase photos of individuals.
            <br><strong>Favorites-</strong>This page will showcase photos that are some of my favorites
        </p>
        <h2>Usability Concepts</h2>
        <p>For the font size of my page, I will title copy be around 25 pt. and my body copy will be around 16 pt. I will have the title of each photo bolded and the process of each will be regular. I will have the title for each photo as my ALT tag. The links for each page will be at the top and I will have a home link.</p>
        <h2>Wireframe Sketches</h2>
