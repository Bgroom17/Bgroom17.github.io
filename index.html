        <p>Photography has changed my life, I have loved it so much. Being able to take photographs is empowering and is a skill I will use my entire life. I truly believe that Heavenly Father guided me in taking this class.
            <br>
        This website shows the skill that I have acquired. It shows many hours of long and sometimes frustrating work. It is something that I am proud of, that shows how far I have come and how much potential I have if I keep working hard. I love photography so much and cannot wait to keep working at it!</p>
